Hex and base64 string encoding and decoding for `Uint8Array` â€” like [`.toHex()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint8Array/toHex)/[`.fromHex()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint8Array/fromHex) and [`.toBase64()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint8Array/toBase64)/[`.fromBase64()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint8Array/fromBase64), which are not yet widely supported.

An order of magnitude faster than most other libraries, and intended to be as fast as is reasonably possible using only plain JavaScript.

## Performance

As at November 2024 on an M3 Pro MacBook Pro, this implementation is about 2x **faster** than the native `.toHex()` in Firefox 133b7, and about 2.5x slower than the one in Safari Tech Preview 207. 

It's also about 2x slower than the native `.toString('hex')` in Node 22.11 and about 5x slower than the one in Bun 1.1.34.

It is many times faster than any standard approach using either string concatenation or `join()`.

Performance tests can be seen at https://jsbench.me/evm3ejel2i/5.

What we do is this:

* If `.toHex()` is present on the object, we just call it.

* Otherwise, we map one-byte source values to two-byte output (ASCII character) values in a `Uint16Array`, and then decode this to a string. We do this in roughly 1MB chunks to avoid huge memory allocations.

We do some manual loop-unrolling, which makes very little difference in Firefox and Safari but speeds things up considerably in Chrome.

A test run looks like this:

```
% npm run test
